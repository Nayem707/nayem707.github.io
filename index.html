      "I’m currently experiencing an issue with my
      <strong> 'LinkedIn'</strong> account where it’s asking for ID
      verification, but I don’t have the required documents. I’ve reached out to
      LinkedIn support to request alternative verification methods. They should
      provide guidance on how to proceed, and I’m hopeful that the issue will be
      resolved soon."
